## What is GPDPL (or LGPD)?

According to Wikipedia,

The General Personal Data Protection Law (Brazil) 13709/2018 (Portuguese: Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD), is a statutory law on data protection and privacy in the Federative Republic of Brazil. The law's primary aim is to unify 40 different Brazilian laws that regulate the processing of personal data. The LGPD contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals, where the data is of individuals located in Brazil, where the data is collected or processed in Brazil, or where the data is used to offer goods or services to individuals in Brazil.

The LGPD became law on September 18, 2020 but its enforceability was backdated August 16, 2020. Sanctions under the regulation will only be applied from August 1, 2021.

The national data protection authority responsible for enforcement of the LGPD is the Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados, or ANPD.
